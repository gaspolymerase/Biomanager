"""Upgrading a lab's database, safely.

When a new version of BioManager opens a database an older one made, it
changes the database to fit: new tables, new columns. This module makes
that safe:

- Before anything changes, it copies the database. On SQLite (the desktop
  app, a small server) the copy is `backups/before-upgrade-<from>-to-<to>-<time>.db`
  in the data folder; the last ten are kept. On PostgreSQL the server's own
  backup service takes one before every update (deploy/host/maintenance.sh
  and the runbook), and the log says so.
- Schema changes are Alembic revisions (migrations/versions/), applied in
  order and recorded in `alembic_version`. The hand-written ALTERs of the
  versions before 0.8 (services.ensure_schema_updates) are frozen: they
  still bring an old database up to 0.8's shape, and revision 0002 marks
  that point. Every change since is a revision, written with the helpers
  in migrations/helpers.py so it can run on a database that already has it.
- A new database is created at the newest shape and stamped with the
  newest revision, so nothing is replayed.
- scripts/upgrade-check.py builds a demo lab with every earlier release,
  upgrades it with this code, and checks the schema matches a new one and
  no row was lost. CI runs it (.github/workflows/upgrade-check.yml).

To undo an upgrade: close BioManager, put the backup copy in place of
biomanager.db, and open the version it came from.

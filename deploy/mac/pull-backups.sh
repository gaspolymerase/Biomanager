# Copy the server's nightly backups to this Mac, so a copy lives somewhere
# other than the cloud VM. Run daily by launchd (install.sh); by hand:
#   ~/Library/Application\ Support/BioManager/pull-backups.sh
#
# Over SSH (Tailscale) as the `biomanager` host in ~/.ssh/config, from the
# server's BACKUP_DIR at /opt/biomanager/backups. A server with other names
# sets them when installing: BIOMANAGER_SSH_HOST=<host in ~/.ssh/config>
# BIOMANAGER_SERVER_BACKUPS=<its BACKUP_DIR, e.g.
# /opt/biomanager/Biomanager/deploy/backups> deploy/mac/install.sh. Only new
# files are copied and nothing is deleted because the server deleted it, so
# a damaged or compromised server cannot empty this copy. Each new database
# dump is checked readable. The newest KEEP are kept.
#
# A macOS notification says when it fails, or when the server's newest
# backup is more than STALE_HOURS old: the server's own alerts cannot
# report that the server is gone.
